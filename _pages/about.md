I'm a third year PhD supervised by Professor Stratis Ioannidis and Professor Jennifer Dy at Northeastern University. I'm interested in provable machine learning and deep learning algorithms and learning theory.

Before joining Northeastern, I achieved my Masters in Biomedical Engineering (Math minor) at Johns Hopkins University with professor Raman Arora and my MSc with Dr. Ben Glocker at Imperial College London.
